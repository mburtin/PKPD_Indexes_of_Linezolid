DESCRIPTION: Model monocomp to reproduce the mouse PK in study of Andes
Parameters are mostly fixed by using the Bigelow study values. 
We use this model to estimate an appropriate Ka and F

[LONGITUDINAL]
input={V1, V2, Q, Cl, Vm, Km, ka, F}

PK:
compartment(cmt = 1, volume = V1, concentration = Cc)
absorption(cmt=1, ka, p=F)
elimination(cmt = 1, Cl)
elimination(cmt = 1, Vm, Km)

compartment(cmt = 2, volume = V2, concentration = Cp)
transfer(from = 1, to = 2, kt = Q)


OUTPUT:
output = {Cc}
