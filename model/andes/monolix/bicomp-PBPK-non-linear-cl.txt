DESCRIPTION:
The administration is extravascular with a first order absorption (rate constant ka).
The PK model has a central compartment (volume V1), a peripheral compartment (volume V2, intercompartmental clearance Q), and a Michaelis-Menten elimination (Vm, Km).

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {V1, Q, V2, Vm, Km, RBP, Kp}

PK:
depot(target=CENTRAL)

EQUATION:
odeType = stiff

CENTRAL_0 = 0
MUSCLE_0 = 0

Cc = CENTRAL/V1;
Cm = MUSCLE/V2;

ddt_CENTRAL = -(Vm*(CENTRAL/V1)/(Km + (CENTRAL/V1))) - Q*RBP*Cc + Q*RBP*(Cm/Kp)
ddt_MUSCLE = Q*RBP*Cc - Q*RBP*(Cm/Kp)

OUTPUT:
output = {Cc}
