DESCRIPTION:
The administration is via an infusion (requires INFUSION RATE or INFUSION DURATION column-type in the data set).
The PK model has one compartment (volume V) and a Michaelis-Menten elimination (Vm, Km).

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {V, Vm, Km}

EQUATION:
odeType = stiff

PK:
; PK model definition
Cc = pkmodel(V, Vm, Km)

OUTPUT:
output = {Cc}
