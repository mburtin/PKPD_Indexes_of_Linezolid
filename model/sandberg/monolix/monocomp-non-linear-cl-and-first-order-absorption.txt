DESCRIPTION:
The administration is extravascular with a first order absorption (rate constant ka).
The PK model has one compartment (volume V) and a Michaelis-Menten elimination (Vm, Km).

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {ka, V, Vm, Km}

EQUATION:
odeType = stiff

PK:
; PK model definition
Cc = pkmodel(ka, V, Vm, Km)

OUTPUT:
output = {Cc}
