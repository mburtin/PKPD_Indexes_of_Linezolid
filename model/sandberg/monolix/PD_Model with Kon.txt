DESCRIPTION:
TKC model SA29213 Run 063 in Files MHB/All data

The PD model is a direct model with adaptative resistance. There is two populations type : one growing and drug-susceptible population (S) and one resting and drug-insusceptible population (R). The total bacterial (B) content in the system (S + R). The adaptative resistance is described by two compartment one with no adaptative resistance (ARoff) and one with presence of adaptative resistance (ARon).
The effect (E) corresponds to stimulation of death.
B0 = Inoculum (log10(CFU/mL))
Bmax = Plateau (log10(CFU/mL))
B = Total bacterial (CFU/mL)
Emax = Maximal rate of effect (h-1)
EC50_S = LNZ concentration needed to reach 50% of Emax for population S (mg/L) 
EC50_R = LNZ concentration needed to reach 50% of Emax for population R (mg/L) 
kon = rate constant for development of adaptative resistance (h-1)
koff = rate constant for return to suceptibility (h-1)

input={B0, Bmax, Kg, Emax, EC50, AMT}
AMT = {use = regressor}

PK:

EQUATION:
; Initial values
t_0 = 0
S_0 = 10^B0 ; DV are in log10 but we want calculation in CFU/mL log(x) = a <-> x = 10^a
R_0 = 0

; PD definitions
B = S + R
Kd = 0

Ksr = (((Kg - Kd) * B) / 10^Bmax) ; equation from PK-PD Modeling of Antibacterial Drugs. Nielsen and Friberg (serves as plateau).

Krs = 0 
koff = 0 ; always under antibiotic pressure

; Effect model - Emax
E = (Emax * Conc) / (Conc + EC50) ; CENTRAL = Amount dose = mg/L for TKC

; ODEs
ddt_S = Kg * S - (Kd + E) * S - Ksr * S + Krs * R 
ddt_R = Ksr * S - Krs * R - Kd * R

; Scale factor
LogB = log10(B)

OUTPUT:
output = {LogB}
table = {Conc}
